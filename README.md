# Video Transcription using OpenAI Whisper

### Technical Approach:
- **Video Upload:** Users upload a video file through a web interface, which is handled by Flask routes. The file is saved to a server directory for processing.
- **Transcription Model:** An automatic speech recognition model, **OpenAI's Whisper**, is used to transcribe the audio track of the video file. The model processes the audio and outputs a transcription of the spoken content.
- **Timestamps and Snippets:** Along with the transcription, timestamps are generated to indicate when each spoken segment occurs in the video. Using ffmpeg, a popular multimedia framework, the application extracts video snippets or frames corresponding to these timestamps.
- **Results Presentation:** The transcribed text, along with the timestamps and video snippets, is presented to the user on a results page.
- **Downloadable Content:** The application provides options for users to download the transcription and video snippets. The transcription is saved as a .txt file with timestamps, and the video snippets are compressed into a .zip file.

### Results:
The end result is a user-friendly interface where individuals can upload videos and receive transcriptions with precise timestamps. Each transcribed segment is accompanied by a corresponding video snapshot, enhancing the understanding of the context. Users can download the full transcription and snapshots for further use.
